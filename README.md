# dynFabDoc - dynamic FabLab Documentation

We all need to build documentation in our fabLabs. 
But I think we could use the gitHub service to provide a high-quality documentation that begginers could take to do a thing from start to end with all steps.

## Goals

1. Simplify documentation in FabLabs (and in other places)
1. All documentations are stored on GitHub in Creative Commons
1. Any modifications are automatically forked from origin and pull requests can be automatically created
1. Smart structure and highly decupled to permit to beginners and experts to do any tutorials (automaticly includes sub-document to provide instructions step by step for beginners and more general for experts)

## Structure

Each repository is a "theme", like : "3D Printer", "2D vector image editor" or "2D laser"

## Improvements

You could improve with a PR or if you think there is a bug anywhere, please provide all steps to reproduce the bug.

Thanks in advance and enjoy it ! :)
